# Reference OS for IOT tries to build minimal images and thus prefers Busybox or
# Toybox over coreutils or any other package providing similar
# functionality. For technical reasons, this is crucial when building
# swupd bundles: Busybox/Toybox must be picked consistently, even when
# a bundle pulls in alternatives like coreutils which normally would
# have a higher priority.
#
# This gets achieved in two ways:
# 1. via refkit-update-alternatives.bbclass we modify all packages
#    so that their update-alternatives priority can be modified
#    during install time
# 2. in refkit-image.bbclass we reconfigure those priorities
#    as necessary
#
# This is still a change that is done consistently for all images,
# whether they use swupd or not, to ensure that the result is
# identical. Doing it at image creation time reduces the need
# for recompilations of packages and opens up the possibility
# for downstream developers to override the defaults while
# reusing pre-compiled binaries from our sstate.

# The swupd update mechanism currently does not cope with user or

# (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/101). Even if it
# did, changing IDs would make the update more complicated (larger
# delta, daemons need to be restarted, etc.), so it is better to
# ensure that IDs are static.
#
# Reference OS for IOT uses the static uid and gid mechanism from OE-core for that
# (http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#ref-classes-useradd),
# with custom support for adding systemd sysusers in Reference OS for IOT's
# systemd-sysusers.bbclass.  The OE-core mechanism for that currently
# lacks support for static IDs and thus cannot be used yet
# (https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9789).
#
# Dynamically assigned IDs are detected and lead to an error during
# the build. For example, the dbus recipe creates a "messagebus"
# group. Not defining that group causes an error when parsing the
# recipe and makes it unusable, leading to the following errors
# during "bitbake dbus":
# ERROR: Nothing PROVIDES 'dbus'
# ERROR: dbus was skipped: Function failed: dbus - dbus: username messagebus does not have a static ID defined.
#
# When building images, the errors shows up as missing components
# which are required for the build, as in "bitbake refkit-image-noswupd":
# ERROR: Nothing RPROVIDES 'udev' (but /work/iot-ref-kit/meta/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-core-boot.bb, /work/iot-ref-kit/meta/recipes-core/initrdscripts/initramfs-framework_1.0.bb RDEPENDS on or otherwise requires it)
# ERROR: Required build target 'refkit-image-noswupd' has no buildable providers.
#
# The advantage of this mechanism is the decentralized assignment of
# IDs without modifying the OS or recipes.
#
# Developers who need to add new entries should add their own mapping
# file to USERADD_UID_TABLES and/or USERADD_GID_TABLES, either in a
# derived distro config or in their local.conf. Reference OS for IOT reserves
# the value range < 2000.
