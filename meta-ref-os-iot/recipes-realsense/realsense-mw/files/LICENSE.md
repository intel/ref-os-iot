4.1        Subject to the restrictions in Section 4.3, Intel Corporation
("Intel") grants to you the following non-exclusive, non-transferable,
         non-assignable, royalty-free licenses (i) under its copyrights
in the Intel-developed portions of the Software and (ii) under third
party    licensors’ copyrights for their respective applications that
may be included in the Software, a sublicense in such third party
licensors’ respective portions of the Software, (and as applicable
subject to Section 4.2 below): to design, develop, debug or otherwise
create or modify Applications, Components or other software products, in
each case, solely in connection with the Purpose, subject to the following:

 

*_Developer Tools_***include libraries, developer documentation,
installation or development utilities, and other materials.  You may use
and distribute the foregoing items internally for the purposes of using
the Software as licensed hereunder, but you may not externally
redistribute them.

*_Sample Source_***may include example interface or application source
code.  You may copy, modify and compile the Sample Source and include it
in your Application and/or Component in binary and source code form
solely for the Purpose.  You may not externally distribute the Sample
Source in any form, including as part of or with your Application and/or
Component.

*_End-User Documentation_*includes textual materials intended for end
users.  You may internally copy and use them solely for the Purpose, but
you may not externally distribute such materials.

*_Licensed Binaries_*are code provided in binary form, including without
limitation, demo (demonstration) applications.  You may internally copy
and use the Licensed Binaries solely for the Purpose.  You may not
externally distribute the Licensed Binaries in any form, including as
part of or with your Application and/or Component.

*_Header Files_*are source files for use by you for the purposes of
using the Software as licensed hereunder, but you may not externally
redistribute them as part of or with your Application and/or Component.

*_ _*

4.2        Notwithstanding Section 4.1 above, the Software may contain
certain open source software, identified in, and licensed in accordance
with, the “license.txt” file or other text or file in the Software. 

*_ _*

4.3        *_Restrictions_.*  Your use of the Software is expressly
limited to and conditioned upon compliance with the following:

 

·         You will not alter, remove or obscure any proprietary notices
from the Software relating to Intel’s or Intel’s licensors’ copyright,
trademark or patent notices.

·         You will make reasonable efforts to discontinue use of the
portions of the Software that you are licensed hereunder to use, upon
Intel’s release of an update, upgrade or new version of the Software. 

·         You may not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, or otherwise
reverse-engineer any portion of the Software provided solely in binary form.

·         You must not disable or by-pass any security features of the
Software, or use the Software to develop Applications or Components that
(i) can disable or by-pass such security features or (ii) can cause a
Security Vulnerability. “Security Vulnerability” means a weakness or
flaw in a product or system’s design, operation or implementation that
could be exploited by an attacker to violate the product or system’s
security or privacy policies, including without limitation, a flaw that
makes it infeasible, even when the product is properly used, to prevent
an attacker from usurping privileges on a user’s system, compromising
its data, security or other operational features. If you become aware
that your Applications or Components can cause a Security Vulnerability,
you agree to (1) immediately notify Intel, (2) take immediate measures
to stop the internal distribution of your Applications or Components,
(3) promptly correct such Security Vulnerability and (4) indemnify Intel
for any claims that may be alleged against Intel due to such Security
Vulnerability.
